A Frontend Netflix clone project
I decided on this clone, as I thought it was a nice way to learn the following tools used

## Tools
- React Compound Components
- Styled Components
- Google Firebase for data hydration and auth
- Fuse for live-search
- React router

## Learning and Learning
This was my first time getting my hands dirty with Compound Component design pattern (as well as using Styled Components).

## What it can do
### Basic overview:
- Home page
- Sign in/ Sign up page (utilizing firebase)
- Profile component to click on your profile (the user is actually hard-coded in as an object.
- Browse page (w/ a video player)

## Running this locally
Clone/download file, npm install to install all the dependencies

### What I can do now
- update the profile picker component:
  - currently this profile picker is hardcoded (as a user object, with hardcoded user name)
  - Need to use signed up user info (getting it back from firebase)
  - set up a favorite icon for users to favorite (or like) some movies

- Build my own unique movie website!
